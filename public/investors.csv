As experienced entrepreneurs and early-stage venture capital investors, we founded Alpha Partners to be an agile co-investor.  We make rapid investment decisions. We’re flexible on investment size. We believe in direct communication and transparency with our partners. While we may assist with fundraising, recruiting, and strategic relationships, we rarely take board seats.

Alpha Partners was founded by experienced early-stage venture capital investors and former entrepreneurs with more than 75 years of combined experience. Our team, including our close advisors, have founded and helped to scale multi-billion dollar venture and private equity firms as well as made hundreds of investments themselves.

As a result, we aspire to be as responsive, transparent, and easy to work with as we can be. Friendly.

>Not a Black Box
Making an investment is about capitalizing on a business opportunity as well as forming a partnership.

Scaling","We invest in state-of-the-art exponential technology companies which have the potential for integral impact, including substantial growth, while implementing the UN SDGs within the Planetary Boundaries.

We focus on seed and early-stage companies. Their leadership team must be strong, their technology must be proven, and should have a short runway to cash flow break-even.

Our regional focus is the European Union with the main emphasis on DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). A few selected investments are also made in the San Francisco Bay Area.

According to our Integral Investing philosophy, the business models of our investees must be transferable to other countries, be scalable to market leadership, and deliver sustainable and risk-adjusted returns on multiple bottom lines as defined by our 6Ps: Parity of People, Planet, and Profit — with Passion and Purpose.

Given our investing expertise, background, and entrepreneurial experience, we are focusing on three main sectors of innovation for life in the 21st century:

Exponential Technology & Digital Evolution: Internet Infrastructure, Artificial Intelligence, B2B IT Solutions, Digital Design
Green Technology: Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, CleanTech, Circular Economy
Life in the 21st century: Future Mobility, Nutrition & Agro, Med Tech, Media & Entertainment Tech

Our thesis is best described in our book ""Integral Investing: From Profit to Prosperity"" by Mariana Bozesan, published by Springer.

We invest pre-seed and seed, writing $100K checks as a founder's first outside capital. This enables entrepreneurs to get started and gain momentum without substantial dilution.

In addition to flexible financing, we take an active role in helping de-risk the startup process. Our team of experienced operators advises on growth, product-market fit, hiring key roles, forming partnerships, and raising future rounds.

We leverage our network to connect portfolio companies with advisors, customers, technical talent and follow-on investors. By sharing playbooks and facilitating pilot projects, we help founders avoid common pitfalls.

Our ideal founders are relentless learners who demonstrate grit, creativity and vision. We believe diverse, well-rounded teams outperform those with narrow expertise. Founders we back question assumptions, communicate effectively, and balance passion with pragmatism.

We designed Couchpotato to provide maximum autonomy with accountability. Our founder-friendly terms empower startups to take risks and maintain control. We drive alignment through transparency and only succeed when our portfolio succeeds.

Fiddlehead Ventures follows two distinct investment theses - Forward Thinging, and Deadpool. The Forward Thinging approach focuses on investing in things, before they become ""a thing"". With Deadpool, we identify undervalued failing and struggling tech companies where significant resources have already been invested, and real assets and value exist.  

Fiddlehead Ventures seeks to identify what's new, exciting, and with plenty of potential for growth before it's in the mainstream. That means beating the bushes, and imagining the business landscape 10 years out.

New Orleans BioInnovation Center,https://neworleansbio.com/,"1441 Canal St, New Orleans, LA 70112",USA,"1. Idea or Patent,2. Prototype,3. Early Revenue","We work on behalf of the US federal government to source startups related to the BARDA DRIVe program. Funding can be up to $750K through the program. Current types of companies we are looking for:

Digital MCMs: Develop novel digital technologies that accelerate the response to health security threats. Proposed solutions should increase access, reduce cost, or more rapidly disseminate medical countermeasures, such as diagnosis and risk assessment capabilities, by:
 Capitalizing on broadly available and easily accessible digital platforms such as smartphones and web applications and/or
 Combining novel analytic approaches, such as AI/ML, with broadly accessible data sources such as images, audio, sensors, or user data from smartphones/wearable devices; or other novel digital data sources.
Digital health tools include smartphone, web, and telehealth applications, data sets, or algorithms that are deployable on commonly available digital devices.

Healing Lungs: Address gaps in ARDS treatment by developing innovative technologies that enable oxygen delivery and gas exchange for severe ARDS patients, prevent secondary lung injury, and do not resort to mechanical ventilation or positive air pressure systems.
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients not responding to mechanical ventilation are placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) as a last resort. This intervention remains labor-intensive, costly, high risk, and is only available at a few specialized centers. DRIVe envisions improved access to affordable, effective, and safe treatment options like ECMO that can be administered outside of the intensive care unit, for severe ARDS patients. Healing Lungs seeks to develop next-generation ECMO advances and oxygen delivery vehicles superior to currently available interventions.

Host-based Diagnostics: When health is compromised by an infection or injury, the body's response can trigger a cascade of protective activities. Host-based diagnostics (HBDs) focus on these responses, not the threat itself, providing a threat agnostic complement to pathogen-based diagnostics. They can aid clinical decision making by providing insight into a patient's past infectious status, current immunity, infection severity, or future status, including the trajectory of deterioration to severe outcomes (eg; sepsis). These threat agnostic approaches not only have potential to map an individual patient's status- HBDs can also help address existing gaps in our ability to respond to unidentified threats.This program will bolster national preparedness by supporting the development, validation, and regulatory approval of host-based tools and approaches, with an emphasis on assessment of the clinical utility. HBDs encompass a broad range of technologies capable of leveraging various data types from an individual such as genomic biomarkers, cellular responses and physiological data, which may be analyzed by integrated algorithms.
Our current areas of focus include:
Pathogen agnostic detection of infection, severity, or health deterioration in clinical settings outside of the hospital
Demonstrate the clinical utility of HBDs for changing patient outcomes
Utilize methods (e.g., cell-mediated immunity, epigenetic markers) that can inform on a patient's prior infectious status or current status of immunity
Stratification of patient subpopulations to guide clinical trial design or identify appropriate treatment

Host-Directed Therapeutics: When health is compromised by infection, insult, or injury, the body's response can trigger a cascade of immune dysregulation and organ dysfunction, leading to poor patient outcomes. Treatments aimed at modulating these responses, known as host-directed therapeutics (HDTs), have the potential to prevent, reduce or mitigate immediate and long-term harm through promoting a balance of healthy cells, tissue, immune system or organ function.HDTs by design target universal responses, representing a threat agnostic approach for a variety of health security threats, including pandemics. They offer a significant advantage for pandemic preparedness by eliminating the need for pathogen identification and pathogen specific treatment, which is a critical capability when facing an emerging or previously unknown pathogen. While HDTS may be used for the treatment of non-infectious conditions (e.g., high blood pressure, autoimmune disorders, oncology), they have not been widely applied to health security problems due to perceived challenges in development or ROI. To catalyze broader implementation of HDTs, we are supporting development of new or repurposed drugs, biologics, or devices.
Our current areas of HDT focus include:
Interventions to prevent or reduce infection progression to severe outcomes
Therapies that improve long term outcomes and prevent health deterioration
Patient stratification to subtype populations for improved clinical management.

Home Diagnostics: Telehealth is now widespread, but most routine testing still requires visits to a clinic or lab. This program is developing disruptive platform technologies to collect and analyze biological samples at home. This technology could revolutionize diagnostics, chronic disease management, and even clinical research, providing better access to care and a more disaster-resilient health care system. 
Support the development and validation of new platform technologies for simple, rapid multiplexed analysis of biological specimens in the home setting.
These novel technologies:
Use non-invasive and minimally invasive samples to provide quantitative information about a patient's health status
Are readily adaptable to a broad menu of test panels to cover a wide range of disease states as well as standard health assessments
Offer rapid results for interpretation by health care providers.

Anti-viral therapies are a critical medical countermeasure against acute viral infections and their long-term sequelae. For many viruses, such as filoviruses, the commercial market provides limited incentives for product developers to evaluate promising candidates. Antiviral therapeutics are generally advanced for a single indication, however they may have efficacy against multiple related viruses due to conserved mechanisms and host/virus proteins.

With the Repurposing Drugs for Biological Threats (ReBooT) program, DRIVe and BARDA's Antivirals and Antitoxins (AVAT) branch aim to support the testing and evaluation of candidate antiviral therapeutics that have been licensed or developed past Phase 1 clinical trials for another indication, but which have a mechanism of action likely to be effective against filoviruses.Drug repurposing, or label expansion, is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for approved or late-stage therapeutics beyond their original clinical indication. With ReBooT, efforts are focused on repurposing safe direct-acting and host-directed therapeutics that have the potential to reduce the mordidity and mortality associated with filovirus infection.
Program funding will support proof of concept studies and help fill critical knowledge gaps to include:
Identifying candidates that can be repurposed, either licensed or beyond Phase 1, with a mechanism of action suggestive of efficacy against the filoviruses
Supporting critical evaluations to determine if the candidate warrants future consideration for product development

Strengthening our ability to respond to physical threats is a critical part of BARDA's strategy. Exposure to substantial doses of ionizing radiation, causes widespread cell death and leads to a spectrum of injuries across multiple organs, also known as Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). Due to the systemic multi-organ pathologies of ARS, fast-acting, effective medical countermeasures (MCM) are needed.
With the Repurposing and Advancing Innovations Against Rad/Nuc (RePAIR) program, DRIVe and BARDA's Chemical, Biological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Division aim to support the testing and evaluation of repurposed drugs that have potential efficacy against ARS.Drug repurposing, or label expansion, is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for approved or late-stage therapeutics beyond their original clinical indication. With RePAIR, efforts are focused on repurposing licensed or late-stage therapeutics as MCMs against ARS.
This includes therapeutics for treating:
Cell Death
Vascular Injury
Bleeding/Coagulation
Ischemia

Data protection deserves special attention to address security and privacy concerns and look for novel ways to protect data in motion and at rest.
• Computing: We look for technologies that enable high-performance computing from commodity resources, allow distributed and edge computing, support stream processing, and enable specialized processors. We also believe that compute requirements ebb and flow, so look for technologies that rapidly provision and configure compute resources.
• Networking: We look for technologies that heighten network adaptivity and enable computation distribution. This includes software-defined networking, edge networks, and 5G technologies. Adaptive networks need secure network controls, so look for technologies that support policy-driven networking and secure network configuration.",VC,$200000,$10000000
